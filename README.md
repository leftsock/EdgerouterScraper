# Edgerouter Scraper

Wrote this for myself, so it has only been tested against an Edgerouter
X running v2.0.9-hotfix.7

The install instructions in 00Readme.txt are for running on Ubuntu Server.
Do not blindly copy and paste the commands. read them line-by-line and
make sure you know what they're doing first!

Good luck!
